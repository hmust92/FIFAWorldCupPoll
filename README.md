# FIFA World Cup Poll Experience!

This application was created in order to capture the essence of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The FIFA World Cup is one of the biggest sporting events in the world. Our group wanted to create an interactive experience for the user where they could enjoy predicting which teams would come on top and also see what the rest of the world was thinking. It was a way for the FIFA World Cup Loving community to come together and see which teams had the most support when taking everything into consideration.

The link to the deployed application is on top of the page. If you want to run this application on your computer, follow these steps. Open your terminal and write:

````
git clone https://github.com/hmust92/FIFAWorldCupPollGame.git
````

Go into the directory in your terminal that has just been cloned and do

````
npm install
````

Write ```npm start``` to run the server, and in your browser type **http://localhost:5000** and the application will run!
